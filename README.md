# MIPSMachineLangGame
A game I made for a project. It plays Connect Four with the user, responding to the user's moves. The game responds to the player's and the computer's moves, and will either declare either one a winner or a tie if the board fills.
It is designed to work with MARS 4.5, but I suppose it could work with any of them. In order to use: just build and run after opening.
